The code first treats test and train separately and creates two data frames containing either all the test data or all the train data 
These are then named nicely and merged to create a master table with all data 
The column names are searched for the mean or std deviation and then the data set is filtered so only the columns containing mean/ std dev are kept 
The activity is then decoded using a lookup table 
A unique data frame of all the person+activity combos is created then a loop is run which subsets the main data frame for the matching values and calcualtes a mean for each column
The final part is decoding the f and t
